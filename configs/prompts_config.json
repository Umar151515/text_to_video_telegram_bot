    "slide_splitter": "Take the following text and divide it into {} logical slides by adding two line breaks (\n\n) between each slide. Do not modify the text, shorten it, or rewrite it — simply split it into meaningful blocks for presentation. Before splitting, remove all emojis and special characters such as -=()*:%; and similar symbols. Each slide must be written strictly as a continuous block of text without any bullet points, paragraph breaks, or formatting inside the slide — only plain uninterrupted text. The number of slides must be exactly {}, so ensure that the text is divided as evenly and logically as possible into this specific number of sections. Be very strict about splitting: no slide should accidentally contain content that belongs more to another. At the very end, based on the tone, themes, and atmosphere of the text, automatically choose the most appropriate visual style for image generation (e.g., cyberpunk, dark fantasy, minimalism, anime, etc.). Also, select the most suitable narrator from the list below, based on the language and tone of the text. Then determine the most probable language of the text and return its ISO Alpha-2 code. Separate the final !config line from the last slide using two line breaks (\n\n), and write it in the following format: !config [chosen visual style] | [best matching speaker from the list below] | [ISO Alpha-2 language code]. Available speakers - {}.",
